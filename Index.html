   <h1>HTML Basics</h1>
   <P>HTML (<strong>H</strong>ypertext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 
     <br />
     <br />

    <em>As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</em></P>
   <h2>So what is HTML?</h2>
   <p>HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of <em>elements</em>, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. </p>
   <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>

   <p>The main parts of an HTML element are as follows;</p>
   <ol>
     <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
     <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
     <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
     <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>To build websites, you should know about HTML — the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.
